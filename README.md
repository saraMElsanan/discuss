# We've moved!

GitHub is adding native discussions support and we're lucky enough to be one of the first communities to try it out.

If you have a question, need help, want to share what you're working on, or just want to talk shop around Tailwind CSS, head over to the discussions area on `tailwindcss/tailwindcss`:

[**Discuss Tailwind CSS**](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/discussions)

We'll keep this old repository around so we have all of the historical discussions available for people to read through, but I've archived the repository so no new issues or comments can be posted. If you want to continue a discussion from this repository, please create a new discussion in our discussions area and link back to the original discussion here if it's helpful.
